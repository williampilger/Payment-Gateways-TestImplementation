# PayPal Gateway Test Integration

**THIS IMPLEMENTATION ISN'T CONCLUDED!**

This sample integrates with a PayPal payment gateway API.

This example **CAN NOT BE IMPLEMENTED** as production environment, cause I didn't worry about code injection and more security questions.
Use this code only for undestand the APIs requests and responses.




## Before Run

You need to create a `cred.php` file in the `_local` directory. This file shold have you credentials, like `_local/cres.sample.php` file.

## Runing

I ran it on a linux machine, using:

> cd src && php -S localhost:80
