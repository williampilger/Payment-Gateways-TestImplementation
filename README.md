# Payment Gateways Test Implementations

This repository gathers **test implementations** of some payment gateways.

I didn't worry about the security of the transactions, relying completely on the information comming from the front-end, witch is not a good practice in a production environment. These implementations only serve to understand the functioning of the APIs in question.


## Comparative

The [comparison spreadsheet](Comparativo_WilliamPilger.xlsx) is completely partial, and depends solely on my personal opinion. I use the OnlyOffice Editors to build this table, other tool can fail to open/edit.
